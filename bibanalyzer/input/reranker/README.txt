How to "rerank" two analyses from Reflexica and Bibanalyzer.

1. Produce an HTML ReferenceManager output and convert it to (save it as) UTF-8
   and place it into the "Reflexica" directory on the same level of this folder.
   
2. Rum RerankerDemo.java and specify the file name of the HTML file (first variable) accordingly.
